Within this file, I will include a link to the website
along with a description of my contingency plan if my site
provider is down (low chance, but definitely a possibility).

**IF THE WEBSITE DOES NOT LOOK FINISHED OR IS MISSING INFORMATION,
CLEAR YOUR SEARCH HISTORY BUT MAINLY MAKE SURE TO CLEAR YOUR CACHE!
WEB BROWSERS SAVE THE FILES OF WEBSITES YOU VISIT TO MAKE THEM LOAD
FASTER, BUT THEY WILL SAVE AND DISPLAY OLDER VERSIONS OF THIS WEB PAGE
IF YOU HAVE OPENED IT BEFORE**

Before you check out the links, I would like to thank you for
giving me this opportunity. I had a lot of fun working on this project,
and I'm really excited to be able to share this site with my friends
for future use!

Website/Project Link: https://walker.rout.ca/projects/ChemFinal/chem.html
Github Link: https://github.com/WalkerRout/ChemFinal

I will also include a short video on how to run the web page locally
on your computer given the file that I will also hand in (it is very
easy, you just drag the "chem.html" file into your web browser).

If dragging the "chem.html" file does not work on your web browser,
I would recommend using a different browser (I know 100% it works on
Chrome, Firefox, and Opera).
